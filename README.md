# Lazyme

- I created my own package named Lazyme. (coz I amðŸ¥±ðŸ¥±)

- This package can be used in machine learning (Data Science) to check the performance of models.

- The best thing about this package is that you donâ€™t have to train and predict every classification or regression algorithm to check performance. This package directly gives you output performance on different models.

- In Lazyme there are two classes present which is smart_classifier(For Classification problems) and smart_regressor (for Regression problems).
# Lazyme Package
- In Lazyme Package.IPYNB you can see how to use it.


# Lazyme for Classification: 
Lazyme will check the performance on this Classification models:
- Passive Aggressive Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Extra Trees Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Classifier
- K Neighbors Classifier
- Support Vector Classification
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- LGBM Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier
- XGB Classifier


And for classification problems Lazyme can give the output of:
- Accuracy Score.
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross validation (Cross validation score)
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- Overfitting (will give accuracy of training and testing data.)
- Precision Score
- Recall Score


# Lazyme for Regression: 
Similarly, Lazyme will check performance on this Regression model:
- Passive Aggressive Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Extra Trees Regressor
- Lasso Regression
- K Neighbors Regressor
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- LGBM Regressor
- CatBoost Regressor
- XGB Regressor


And for Regression problem Lazyme can give an output of:
- R2 Score.
- Cross validation (Cross validation score)
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- Overfitting (will give accuracy of training and testing data.)


# How to use it:
- Download this Lazyme.py file and save it in your drive where Anaconda is located.
- Then just write from lazyme import smart_classifier, smart_regressor
- Then use it on any dataset.
